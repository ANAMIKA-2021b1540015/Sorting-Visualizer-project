A sorting visualizer app is an interactive tool designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work by providing a visual representation of the sorting process. Here are some key features and descriptions of such an app:

Key Features: Algorithm Selection: Users can choose from various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Heap Sort, etc.

Visual Representation: The app displays the array to be sorted as bars or other graphical elements whose heights or positions represent the values.

Step-by-Step Animation: The app animates the sorting process, showing each step of the algorithm in action. This helps users see how elements are moved or swapped in each iteration.

Speed Control: Users can adjust the speed of the animation to either slow down for detailed observation or speed up to see the overall process quickly.

Input Customization: Users can input their own arrays or choose from predefined sets of data. Some apps may also provide random array generation.

Code Display: Many sorting visualizer apps include a section where the code for the currently selected algorithm is displayed, often highlighting the current line of execution.

Progress Indicators: Some apps feature progress indicators, such as counters for the number of comparisons or swaps made during the sorting process.

Pause/Play/Reset Controls: Users can control the animation with play, pause, and reset buttons, allowing them to start, stop, and reset the sorting process at any time.

Educational Descriptions: The app may include explanations or descriptions of each algorithm, providing insights into their time and space complexities and best/worst-case scenarios.
